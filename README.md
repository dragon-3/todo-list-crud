# todo-list-crud
The goal of this project is to make a todo list  with backend data (server-json) where users can call crud functions on it.

How to setup json server: 
- make a folder called server-api
- in the terminal, run `npm init --yes`
  again, run `npm i --save json-server`
- make a db.json file

this will set you up for the backend.
